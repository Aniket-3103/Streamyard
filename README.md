# Streamyard

It is live streaming website where user's audio and video is captured from browser and is live streamed on YouTube directly.


**I've used node js, express js, socket.io and docker to build this website. 
Docker is used to create containder and it is where ffmpeg is intalled.**

For front-end, I've used simple **HTML** and **CSS**

**To build docker container and to run application: docker compose up**
